🌌 Hello there, I’m Betül 👋  
🧑‍🚀 Aspiring Data Scientist | 4th-Year Computer Engineering Student  

I’m currently navigating my journey through the **data universe**, exploring how machine learning, software engineering, and intelligent systems can be used to solve **real-world problems**.

🛰️ **My Mission**  
I work on **machine learning models** and data-driven systems with a clear goal:  
to turn raw data into meaningful insights and practical solutions.  
At my core, I’m a **problem solver**.  
I use software not only to build projects, but also to improve productivity, automate workflows, and make systems smarter and more efficient.

🪐 **What I’m Exploring**  
- 🤖 **Data Science & Machine Learning** — building, training, and evaluating models  
- 🧠 **AI-driven systems** — focusing on real use cases rather than purely theoretical work  
- ⚙️ **DevOps & Cloud** — learning how projects survive beyond development and reach production  
- 🔐 **Network Security** — understanding the reliability and safety of intelligent systems

🌠 I’m especially interested in how ideas move from **experimentation to deployment**.  
That’s why I study containerization, cloud platforms, and DevOps practices - because even the best model needs a stable orbit to operate in.

🛰️ **My Tech Stack**  
- 🧬 **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, 
- 🧠 **ML & AI**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, OpenCV, YOLO  
- 🗄️ **Database & Backend**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js  
- ☁️ **Cloud & DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, Apache Airflow, AWS, Huawei Cloud  
- 🛠️ **Tools**: Git, Linux, VS Code, IntelliJ  

🚀 **Current Trajectory**  
Continuously learning, experimenting, and refining my skills to become a well-rounded engineer who can design, build, and deploy end-to-end AI solutions.

✨ *Still exploring. Still learning. Still improving - one iteration at a time.*
